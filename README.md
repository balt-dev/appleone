# Apple I Emulator
This is a simple Apple I emulator. You can find a built binary in the Releases section on the right.

This project uses [r6502](https://github.com/balt-dev/r6502) to emulate the 6502 microprocessor.

[See the Apple I manual for details.](https://ia601903.us.archive.org/17/items/Apple1Manual1976/Apple1Manual1976.pdf)
